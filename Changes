Revision history for Perl module Lingua::EN::Numbers

2.00 2014-08-16
    - Finally dropped the legacy OO interface (which was only the main
      public interface for one release in 1999. So bumped major version.
    - Expanded SEE ALSO to give a small description of each module, and
      added Lingua::EN::Fractions at the same time.
    - Module had "require 5.004", but the code now requires 5.006.
    - Improvements to wording of DESCRIPTION.

1.07 2014-05-27
    - Added github repo to pod
    - Clarified authorship history
    - Improved the DESCRIPTION wording.

1.06 2014-01-12

    - Added "use warnings"
    - Added Lingua::EN::Inflect to SEE ALSO in doc
    - Added MIN_PERL_VERSION => 5.006 to Makefile.PL
    - Added PREREQ_PM to Makefile.PL
    - Added ExtUtils::MakeMaker to CONFIGURE_REQUIRES in Makefile.PL
    - Added Test, Test::More and bigint to TEST_REQUIRES in Makefile.PL

1.05 2013-11-24

    - Added github repo to metadata in Makefile.PL
    - Specified license type as GPL in Makefile.PL
      (to match what the documentation already says)

1.04 2012-06-21

    - Added links in SEE ALSO to all similar modules, and to the review
      I did of all such modules for English.
    - Corrected SEE ALSO reference to a non-existent module
      (reported by Karen Etheridge)

1.03 2011-11-20

    - Fixed bug in handling of very large numbers (when using bigint).
      Reported by Steve Flitman, fix from Ben Bullock

1.02 2011-11-20

    - Neil Bowers <neilb@cpan.org> has taken over maintenance
    - fixed a bug affecting numbers over 1 million, where the right-hand
      three digits are 0\d\d (i.e. 99 or less), you'd get a rogue comma.
      e.g. 1001001 became "one million, one thousand and, one"
    - renamed ChangeLog to Changes, and reformatted to CPAN::Changes::Spec


1.01 2005-01-05

    - total rewrite
    - It's more gooder now, in interface, internals, and accuracy.
    - More tests.
    - Mostly backwards compatable.  (But if you relied on the olde
      stylee "British" mode, with "billiards" et al, you're out of
      luck.)
